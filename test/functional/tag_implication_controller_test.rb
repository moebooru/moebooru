    # Can't easily test the update action. The daemon process does the actual work.
    # Anything we create inside this test is created within a transaction, so any database
    # connection outside of this one won't see any changes. We can disable transactional
    # fixtures but this interferes with other tests. Just assume the action works correctly
    # and test the logic of update in the unit tests.
